The Performance Tests of the custom model class of our Subsampled Newton Optimizer include three datasets of the UCI database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets):
iris.csv, wine.csv and automobile.csv

We Plotted the Performance of our model with ```regularization_strength=1e-4``` and ```subsampling_parameter=0.5``` against
the perormance of common Optimizers: SGD & ADAM, each with ```batch_size=32```and ```learning_rate=0.01```
Each optimizer and our model ran 100 epoch for 10 runs, while the plots show their average loss convergence.

We did that for each of the three datasets for differently deep neural nets: one one layer net, one 5 layer net and one 20 layer net.
